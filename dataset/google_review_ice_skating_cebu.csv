3 months ago,"They have time slots to choose from. Food stalls nearby. There was a waiver form you need to fill which the cashier forgot to tell us that we eventually found out when we were about to get our skating shoes. It was a bit chaotic when we were inside to get our skating shoes. There was no proper line and some would just cut in line probably because they are excited to get to the rink. There are also extra fees for the bear, locker and socks. The socks cost about 50 pesos and they say its important to buy if the socks you're wearing does not cover until your calves because people could get rash due to many people using the shoes. Helmets are not sturdy and smelly due to sweat from previous user. But I'm in for the experience so I just shrug off my whole chaotic encounter. There were figure skaters practicing and playing around at the rink too so it was entertaining to watch.",4 stars,2024
3 months ago,"Was looking through old photos and came across photos from when I skated mid December and got reminded about how bad my skating experience was‚Ä¶ first, while lining up, I witnessed the guard very rudely speak to multiple of the other customers and treat them with no respect. Very unprofessional needs more training, perhaps even switch out for a different guard. I also asked him twice if we could go in yet, and both times he ignored me. Upon entering the skates were not only stinky but one of the skates my friend received had broken laces? I don‚Äôt know how that was allowed. The ice was honestly really dangerous too. It was very bumpy and had a lot of holes that you could very easily trip on. Crowd control was not that great either, everyone was everywhere made it even more dangerous to skate. Overall it was okay, but would‚Äôve been more stressing if my friends weren‚Äôt distracting me from the chaos.",2 stars,2024

4 months ago,"I gave it two star because of the skating shoes is super old, it's not sharp enough, and the entrance smell feet . The floor in ice skating area has alot of bumps so bit disappointing , can cause accidents especially for the beginners and children.
But at the end still have fun.
Entrance fee is 330 good for 2 hours.",2 stars,2023

3 months ago,"The experience was fun, but the skating shoes were so old and dull hope you could upgrade them... also there's portions of the ice that is very bad it could cause accidents. The bump cars compromises the space of the public skaters and also for the enrolled figure skaters considering the high price you have to pay for the entrance. The regular guard is so rude, so unapproachable and disrespectful, needs more training.",1 star,2024

1 month ago,My first time and I'm scared but I enjoyed it  üòÅ ‚Ä¶,5 stars,2024
1 year ago,they have scheduled times for in and outs so i would highly suggest checking it out first to plan ahead bc it tends to get a bit busy. we dont rlly know how to skate and just went there for the experience and also to try out ice skating. enjoyed it but we only got to skate for less than 30minutes (we got a 2hr pass) bc our feet are hurting already lol. the skating shoes are a bit old alrdy but ofc still usable.,4 stars,2023
1 year ago,"Best place to experience skating, that you dont have to travel far from Cebu.

Expect the following:
1. Weekends and holidays long queue to purchase ticket.
2. Another que to get inside.
3. Shoes are old.
4. If you have big size of your shoes I dont suggest you try skating because their sizes are small and you will not enjoy skating.

What we did, First, fill up the waiver, second while you fall in line for the ticket, someone from your group also will fall in so that when you have the ticket it will be easy for your group to get inside. Visit with a group because it will be fun, rent a locker to keep safe your valuables TIP: put inside your things in one go so that you will not have to open your locker again because it will ask for another coin for you to open again.

Rent a polar bear, if its your first time, you will need it.",4 stars,2023
1 year ago,Sm Ice skating is located in upper floor Sm seaside. Many young people come here for play. but it need to line and waiting. Price for 2 hour is 300p. Very nice experience must try!!,5 stars,2023
1 year ago,"It is a must experience, I came in the field without any experience and no training guides, dropped a lot as expected but got a hang of it a little bit after two hours or so.
So far, it was really challenging but super fun, it's a must try.
I would say that I got some leg cramps but that is partly my fault for not paying for the guide training snow bears that are meant for beginners, they were pretty expensive in a whopping 100 peso for rental.
I could say one of the downsides is the somewhat of a lack of maintenance for the Ice skating shoes or whatever they're called, some of them are very dirty and it irritated a bit of my skin allergies.
There's no staff on the field so I'm not sure if there's a lot of safety in mind, probably too sure that all beginners will buy the newbie bears for guidance.
Still a pretty nice experience to have though.
I saw some of the new kids falling over including myself and there's no staff whatsoever to check if they are ok or not and most people wouldn't care and just continue flexing their Skating skills which annoyed me a bit.
The area is also near with Food places so after a long tiring skate you can chill with your family or friends, or with yourself and eat good food.",4 stars,2023

4 years ago,"FUN IN ICE.  I always visit this place because my 6- year old loves to skate on ice.  The rink is very spacious. They have plenty of watchers who will constantly ensure that the rules in the place are followed. As long as my daughter loves this, I love this, too.",5 stars,2020
4 years ago,"The reason why I gave 4 stars its because the SM ICE SKATING RINK should include in their Fee - a short Tutorial and Guide/Assistance for FIRST TIMERS. Nevertheless, the service and staff are great. Though there are limited snacks inside though. The SM Ice Skating Rink is a perfect place for your dream Ice Skating experience. They have a 30-minute Ice Resurfacing Schedule at various timelines of the day.",4 stars,2020
5 years ago,"I was a first-timer and preferred not to hire a coach, so the first few rounds were VERY challenging. But the whole experience was fun, except that my feet hurt not because of all the skating but because of the ice skates. I've got no idea why the skates seemed to hurt my feet every time even though I chose the right size.

The place was not very huge and seemed a bit too crowded, maybe because it was on a Saturday. There were loads of children.

At the weekends, you can avail only the Unlimited Skating, no other choices, for PHP420. Make sure to add PHP50 to your budget - for the locker, to make sure your things are in a safe place whilst you skate, for peace of mind. ;)",4 stars,2019

3 months ago,I would highly suggest the people should just go on one direction either clockwise or counterclockwise so that people will not clash. That is how it's done in UK so that no one will clash and the professionals can skate round in the middle in the same direction.,2 stars,2024
4 years ago,"It was my first time to try ice skating and it was hard to do in actual rather than just thinking on how to do it. But anyone can get better on it with constant practice and training with the application of basics. The location is a great place to experience actual ice skating. And also a great place and time to bond with family, friends and loved ones.",5 stars,2020

Good place to burn some energy.",4 stars,2023

7 years ago,A whole lot of fun for the kids but they are quite a bit pricier than a movie and they don't appear to have per hour rates. They haven't maintained their stock of available sizes. Quite a number of sizes were unavailable early in the day and they don't sell skates in the shop.,3 stars,2017
1 year ago,"Went to play here last 2019 before COVID and went there again recently, its much better now since its not that crowded as it used to be. The staff are there and alert to watch over any injuries. We didn't have that much fun since we didnt know how to skate and didn't ""rent"" a coach. We just went to try it and overall it was fun. A little pricey though but fun.",4 stars,2023

Their largest shoes are only a size 9 or something which were way too small for me (I have size 10.5 feet) so my feet were cramped and got really sore after the session.",3 stars,2020

Small lockers which you can open only one time for 50php!!, most disturbing was the really loud music, hardly understood my son when he talked to me, ice quality good.",2 stars,2018
4 years ago,"I love skating. This is the best hobby that I found and I skate for the first time in 2017. The unlimited skating is P420, but pay P500 or P1000 and the locker is only P50, cheaper. But last June, I had an incident, I slided when driving and fighting in polar bears and I am only unlimited, I choose that I wouldn't have a polar bear because it is expensived. In other words, the skating rink has a cleaning time in every skating.",5 stars,2020
5 years ago,"Great place to have fun with your friends. For those first timers I recommend you guys to use the polar bears (which is 100 per hour).

Good thing it‚Äôs right across the Foodcourt in case the kids get hungry or thirsty.

This is our go to place whenever we have to wait for other family members to finish shopping or having their nails done. We sit in the bleachers enjoying the antics of the skaters while doing FB, texting or doing puzzles to pass the time. Then it‚Äôs time to go home. :)",5 stars,2019

4 years ago,"At 61 Im a bit old to get on the ice skates but our kids sure had a great time.  It was a fun day watching them learning to ice skate.   The staff was very helpful as they were being sized for skates.

To help they have these Polar Bear stabilizers that the kids push around the rink to help them get their ice legs.   I have never seen those before but it sure helped them stay steady for their first time.

Shout out to the Squid Snack kiosc just across from them.  Squid snacks are amazing,  they the BBQ and Spicey.",5 stars,2020
