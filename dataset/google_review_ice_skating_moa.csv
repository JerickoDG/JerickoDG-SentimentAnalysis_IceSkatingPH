If your planning to go, just a heads up, register and secure your slot first early so that you'll have your slot. The activity is every two hours. Make sure to bring  a jacket, and don't use shorts if your a newbie. It's normal to fall but don't worry it doesn't hurt much. Just enjoy the 2 hours I guarantee that it's worth it.",5 stars,2024

11 months ago,"Ambience: the place is festive and properly lit. We went in as part of the first batch of the 2 hour pass, so the rink is not crowded. There are several skaters who i think are pros that are practicing around, some are ice skating students and most people are like us, just casual skaters. üòä Be sure to bring socks for hygiene reasons. They have lockers for rent, so one can secure their belongings.

Staff and service: we are satisfied with all those encounters we had with their staff. From the ticket buying, to the guard at the entrance, ice skates keeper and locker custodian.

Please be aware that their operating time is different with mall hours and the 2 hour pass starts at 11:15 am and cut-off at 6:30pm during weekend. Different schedule for weekdays. See the photo i attached with this review for the price and schedule.

Parking: it is located inside MOA, parking is available all around the mall.",4 stars,2023

2 years ago,"The kids really enjoyed ice skating and had so much fun!

To give a little bit of review though, maybe because it recently opened, I mean it was closed because of pandemic, so people are flocking and eager to ice skate that caused long lines at the counter. We queued for 30 minutes at around 1PM, the afternoon pass already sold out and what was available is only the 5:15PM 2-hour skate.

Despite being crowded it was still a fun, accident free afternoon.

Btw, you can bring food inside. The only snack you can buy from is Potato Corner fries which took 40 mins to be served. If you have a companion they can buy from outside restaurants.",4 stars,2022
5 months ago,"Rude, impatient, inhospitable staff. Went there during opening hours on a weekday, yet overall service and experience was horrible. Skates given are also too worn out.

I also found fresh gum inside the skates after asking for a resize, which does not make sense considering the rink just opened (please check on the employee that gives out the skates -- they also gave out faulty skates)

Whole experience was unbearable!",1 star,2023
4 months ago,Typical ice skating rink. Crowded as to be expected of a rink located in a large shopping mall. They charged me the price of a movie ticket just to go in and watch my 7yo daughter skate. I hate these kind of captive pricing schemes. Should be against the law. I'm trying to keep my 7yo daughter safe. It's not like I'm trying to watch Connor McDavid practice.,3 stars,2023
1 year ago,"The mall of asia ice skating rink is quite spacious. Even though there are alot of people, it is still not too crowded because they do crowd control. You can book a slot every 2 hours or get a ticket for unlimited time the whole day or half day.

They also have a locker which you can pay for a fee. The biggest downside is the smelly helmet and smelly skates. Definitely feels unsanitized and unclean. They should really do something on the cleanliness of the rental items.",3 stars,2023

5 years ago,"Full-sized rink with a manageable volume of people for one to speed up. Not many of the visitors are stable on the skates so you need to keep an eye out.

400 PHP for a single adult, or 600 for two. Add another 50 PHP for a locker to stow away your belongings whilst on the ice. You're allowed to determine your shoe size before borrowing a pair of skates through a set of foot castings.

The above prices are only for figure skates, which have those horrible spikes at the front. Not until we were inside did we found out that the hockey skates were an additional 400 PHP per head.",3 stars,2019

I also thought that MOA has their rink outside the mall with a different building, but it was on the main building (I guess) and the space for skating was quite okay. During our visit, a lot of people were there, so there's a 'traffic jam' on the locker area as well as the space outside the rink.

5 years ago,"My fianc√© and I had a great time on the ice, but if there is one bad experience I had it would be the 'meh' attitude from the ice skate staff, I specifically asked for hockey type skates and the staff was adamant they didn't have anything like that. So, fine I put on the male figure ice skates which were absolutely uncomfortable. Since I already paid the entrance fee, why not right?

5 years ago,"We came here(MOA) to try out ice skating in the Philippines. According to my daughter, the rental skates are big and heavy and the blades are dull. The alternative is to rent hockey skates for an hour at over 400 pesos. My son said the blades on the hockey skates, an old pair of Bauer Vapors, are also dull.  Admission is about 500 pesos for a full day. That means you can skate for a while, then take off and come back later to skate. The rink closes when the mall closes.
We did not see any facility for sharpening skates.
There was a hockey practice at 8:30pm but weren‚Äôt allowed to watch it.
We asked if there‚Äôs a Zamboni and were told that there is one. We never saw it though. The ice rink is currently located on the third floor of MOA. I think it was originally on the ground floor. So I doubt that the ice is resurfaced at all.

Also, those at the cashier step 2 are rude, the ones who are too lazy to swipe the card, the machine for card payment is always offline! when you get angry, they just say that the card is fine, please educate yourself about using the card!!!! We have already visited a few times. but your reason is always offline when card payment! better remove it as an option for payment!!! We are just wondering because other establishments all their card terminals are working but this skating rink in our five visits is always offline!!! The cashier at STEP 2 is doing more work than to input the card!!! The skates are torn that's not minimaintained! Your staff need to be retrained at the skating rink MOA.

When I first saw it, it suddenly appeared in front of me and I wondered why. Why is it so hot? That's what I thought, but I also thought that ice skating, a winter sport, could be practiced in hot weather and places. Above all, this coolness has become a place of relaxation in the Philippines, and considering that it has even led to the birth of Olympic athletes, I think it is a great achievement.
