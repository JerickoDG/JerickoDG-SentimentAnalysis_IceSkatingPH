The SM Megamall Skating Rink offers a cool escape from the bustling mall atmosphere, providing a fun and energetic experience for both beginners and seasoned skaters alike.

The rink itself is well-maintained, with smooth ice that facilitates easy gliding. Skating here is a breeze, and the spacious layout ensures that even during peak hours, you won't feel too crowded. The rental skates are in good condition, although bringing your own pair is always an option for those with specific preferences.

The rink's ambiance is vibrant, complemented by upbeat music that adds to the overall enjoyment. It's an ideal spot for friends and families to gather, offering a blend of recreation and exercise. For those looking to improve their skills, the rink occasionally offers lessons, making it accessible for beginners eager to learn the ropes.

One downside might be the occasional long lines during peak hours, but the wait is generally worth it once you hit the ice. The ticket prices are reasonable, making it a cost-effective activity for a day out.

Overall, the SM Megamall Skating Rink provides a delightful experience for skaters of all levels. Whether you're looking for a casual outing or a more serious skate session, this rink offers an enjoyable escape within the heart of the mall. Lace up your skates and glide away for a refreshing and entertaining time.",5 stars,2024

1 year ago,This is a pretty big skating rink at first I thought it was small but after getting up close and getting inside and experiencing it it is very large. It‚Äôs better to come Monday through Friday where you can have a little more space on the weekends this place is beyond packed I mean jam packed and for the line is out the door around the building on the weekends. However a very nice addition they do have a set of bleachers to sit on or in while you watch your company ice skate I would say there‚Äôs about 12 to 15 rows and then there‚Äôs two sets Bleachers which is really accommodating so I have to give them a higher star then I was going to just because of that. Also their prices are pretty fair not too bad for Large City and such a large skating rink. Teresa skating rink you will need to go all the way to the very top floor that‚Äôs where it is located.,5 stars,2023
1 year ago,"It was okay.

Skating rink was okay. Skating experience was good as they have attendants inside where when they saw you fell or struggling they are kind enough to help you and also teach you the basics. They have coach where you can rent for 30 mins for 200php (if I heard it right). At that time they no longer have available coach.

We paid for 399php per person good for 2 hours (adults and kids), entry is per batch. Since we are not a pro we rented 2 ""polar bears"" for 125php each. It will be like your walking stick to help you during skating. I highly recommend this for first timers like us. Then 50php each locker.

What I don't like here is it seems like they don't prioritize the health protocol. Literally, once you return the skate shoes, helmet, wrist band locker key, I never saw them disinfecting it. (Upon entering nor upon leaving) And they no longer have alcohol in the dispenser. I asked for it twice so I ended up going back to my locker to get my own alcohol.

I don't like how they organize the queue and how they want you to wear skating shoes first before giving your locker key even when you already paid for it. Imagine, putting your things inside the locker walking from the chair to the locker and TAKE NOTE WEARING SKATING SHOES! They should have considered that not all lockers were positioned eye level, what about those lockers at the bottom!? We asked for it before wearing the boots but they declined to give it as probably the locker was just a one time use.

I will give it a 3 star because the kuya who assisted us during skating was really nice and my inaanak enjoyed.",3 stars,2023
8 months ago,"Very poor process. Its already 2023 and they are still not digitalized. It takes more than 1hr just to pay and another 1hr at least before you can enter. The line is ao long, there are 3 cashiers but only one is working. If you have kids, one adult is required to go inside and have to pay for no reason even though your kids can do it by themselves as they have experience in ice skating already. We even bought tickets online but you still need to queue as they said official tickets have to be redeemed in the counter. Buying tickets online is useless!!! Very disappointed.",1 star,2023
1 year ago,"Aug 2022: They are super organized now than before. From the lockers down to the polar bear rental, everything is in order. They limit the entry of people every 2 hours. That's why the ice skating rink is not that crowded. Kudos to the management and staff for making said changes. Good job!!! üëèüèª üëèüèªüëèüèª

Mar 2023: They are super organized and they also have Friday Disco On Ice üòä The only downside is that the skating shoes are in bad condition and it has a terrible smell. Hopefully, they can address this issue ASAP. They also have Taters food stall inside.",4 stars,2023
7 months ago,"Went to buy ticket at around 2PM however the next scheduled time to go inside the rink would be 5PM. Process was smooth to get the skating shoes for our sizes and locker. When it's time to get inside the rink, I noticed that the rink seems a bit damp/wet. I remember when I was younger that whenever we go to the old skating rink from SM Megamall that the ice is dry and it doesn't have any water forming inside the rink. And I feel that it's easier to skate if the ice looks dry and not wet.",3 stars,2023
1 year ago,"The staff were really nice, especially the skate rental attendants. The service was exceptional.

The only problem is that none of the skates available for rent (size 9) were sharp. There was zero edge on the blade and clearly have not been sharpened for a long time. Stating on dull blades is a very serious safety issue. If there is no edge on the blade, there is no ability to turn or even balance. This is very dangerous. I would not recommend this business until they have the ability to sharpen the skates.",1 star,2023

You are in a megamall, and you have ONE pair of 9s?  Lol... amateur hour here at the ""greatest"" mall on the Philippines.  More like the laziest.

5 months ago,"The Changing/Rest Area needs Improvement!

As a Regular on Sundays, I really hope the shower rooms are modified or converted into changing rooms

When hockey players and figure skaters are crammed in the morning at the registered skaters area, there's overcrowding that happens. Not only that everyone's skate blades, it doesn't matter if you're a figure skater, hockey player or speed skater, the pads are not covered enough to protect everyone's blades

It would be nice to have some privacy while skaters change into their costumes or gear as well. Utilizing the shower/changing room would really help with this problem

The Ice
Maybe it's the weather, but those spiky metal sheets on the ceiling are creating water droplets that make the ice really bad. Maybe it's time to remove the metal sheets from the ceiling and replace them with something more practical?",3 stars,2023

Hahaha also there are a lot of people when we skate and seems that it was overcrowded especially on the sides handle.

Anyways, we tried the 2hrs instead of the unli hours. It's enough amount of time because you'll get exhausted easily of you're a beginner. Locker room rental for your valuables and shoes are php50. The shoes are not new and bring thicker socks so that you won't wound yourself in the shoes aglet metal holes inside.

Good for beginners who would like to have fun.",3 stars,2023

Rate is 450php unlimited skating
100php for the Polar Bear rental (1hour) - this will help you to balance while skating

4 years ago,"We had so much fun Celebrating our 7th year anniversary here at Megamall Ice Skating Rink last 02/16/2020.

Trying this ice skating for the very first time for both of us was so lit. ü§ôüèº

5 Pointers

1st: It was not easy to walk at the ice with the ice skate. Kudos to those who are trying really hard to practice dancing with it, you guys are awesome.
I best suggest to rent a polar bear for a firt timer. It really helps.

2nd: I forgot to bring a jacket with me it was so cold inside the rink. So, I recommend don't forget to bring one jacket with you guys.

3rd: For you to enjoy the moment try to copy-cat the others. I swear, it can help you to move slowly but surely.

4th: Don't forget to record a video clip when you are a first timer. I bet you, it will makes your jaw and belly hurt due to laughing hard. Record every moment and have fun.

5th: Don't forget to take a photo and slay your ice skate. As if you've never been through many struggles strolling with it. ‚õ∏",5 stars,2020
1 year ago,"They have cut off even if you are paying for unlimited ice skating. On weekends, if you arrive at 1pm, there's tendency that your time in will be 3:15pm. If you have a 2-hr ticket (limited time), chances are, you'll be at 3:00 or 5:30 batch. With the long lines coming in, plus long lines in getting shoes, and wearing it, you will start to skate at around 3:30 or 3:45pm. They will ask you to leave the ice at 4:30 to resurface the rink and your time will end at 5:00 pm (so, that's basically 1 hour only, not 2hrs!). They will not let you come in anymore after they clean the rink. Lockers are for one time use (one open and one close), they will lock your locker and confiscate your things if you opened it for any reasons at all. If you rest and take off your ice skating shoes, they will confiscate the shoes (no shoes on the floor), and you need to fall in line again to get one (long lines during cleaning period). Very, very frustrating.",3 stars,2023
1 year ago,"Good place for those who know how to ice skate. Not so beginner friendly. Polar bears that serve as guides are not always available. You need to line up on the waiting list. It is more okay if you have your own shoes as your exact size may not be available on your schedule. Skating shoes are included in the price, but most of the shoes are old. Good to try, but I'm not thrilled to go back.",3 stars,2023

4 weeks ago,"Finally! 1st time trying ice skating and super FUN! I think you can pay less if you buy online, but we did the research too late. Either way, we had a great time and we were so tired that we didn't finish the 2 hours ü•≤ we rented the teddy bear for ‚Ç±125/hour, would definitely try again next time ü•∞",5 stars,2024
4 months ago,"First time ice skating and I experienced super fun. They have padisco lights and for newbies you can rent a polar bear. The guides are also super helpful because they will teach you how not to fall, but along the way you'll also learn something so for sure the 2nd time I go I'm not stuck on one side anymore.",5 stars,2023
1 year ago,"I went at 6 o'clock on a Saturday and couldn't get in because I didn't have enough shoes.
I went at 6pm on Sunday and was told to go in at 7:30.
There is a 2-hour pass and a day pass, and 2 hours is enough to ride.
If you get a 2-hour pass, you'll have to wait if you don't go on time, so it's better to go on time.
Times and fees are attached with photos.

Temperature - It was short-sleeved shorts and it wasn't cold at all. I was almost sweating. There doesn't seem to be a need to bring thick clothes.

Shoes - There were no sizes 10 and 11, so I wore size 12. There is a size measuring machine so you don't have to find out in advance. And if you go at 5 or 7 o'clock, your shoes may be dirty and wet because other people wore them at the previous time.

Lockers - I ordered a 2-hour pass for two people, and lockers were automatically included in the receipt. 50 pesos is automatically added.
First, I had to put my shoes and bag in, but it was full after I put in one backpack. I went into the skating rink with my bag and got kicked out. You cannot carry bags inside. If you have a lot of luggage, buy more lockers.

Polar Bear - Hold and ride is a tool for beginners. It's 100 pesos per hour, but no one cares about the time. And because there are not enough numbers, if you rent it late, you have to wait with a waiting number.
They are also made so that you can sit on Polar Bear's lap, and although they are all different sizes, they are the same price. I rented a small one and couldn't even sit on it, so I ended up replacing it later. They say I can't exchange it with other people, but I still don't understand.

People - Most people are not good at riding. And there are about 10 to 20% of people who are very good at riding, and they seem to be aspiring athletes or practicing professionals. The receptionists were not friendly.",3 stars,2023
3 months ago,"There are sizes 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13, but no 10? Didn't even say there was no stock before I paid the P450. The skates are still smelly + The ice was not properly cleaned before our batch",1 star,2024

It's 450p and the shoes are also cheap.
Locker fee is 50p, unlimited times a day‚òùÔ∏èüòâ
You are free to come and go.
Short sleeves and jeans are OK.
I think it is better for children to wear gloves.

You can almost have fun skiing just like in Japan ‚òùÔ∏è",5 stars,2019
