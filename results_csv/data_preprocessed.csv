"They have time slots to choose from. Food stalls nearby. There was a waiver form you need to fill which the cashier forgot to tell us that we eventually found out when we were about to get our skating shoes. It was a bit chaotic when we were inside to get our skating shoes. There was no proper line and some would just cut in line probably because they are excited to get to the rink. There are also extra fees for the bear, locker and socks. The socks cost about 50 pesos and they say its important to buy if the socks you're wearing does not cover until your calves because people could get rash due to many people using the shoes. Helmets are not sturdy and smelly due to sweat from previous user. But I'm in for the experience so I just shrug off my whole chaotic encounter. There were figure skaters practicing and playing around at the rink too so it was entertaining to watch.",they have time slot to choose from food stall nearby there be a waiver form you need fill which the cashier forget tell us that we eventually find out when be about get our skate shoe it bit chaotic inside no proper line and some would just cut in probably because be excite rink also extra fee for bear locker sock cost 50 peso say its important buy if youre wear do not cover until your calf people could rash due many use helmet sturdy smelly sweat previous user but im experience so i shrug off my whole encounter figure skater practice play around at too entertain watch,4 stars,2024,cebu
"Was looking through old photos and came across photos from when I skated mid December and got reminded about how bad my skating experience was‚Ä¶ first, while lining up, I witnessed the guard very rudely speak to multiple of the other customers and treat them with no respect. Very unprofessional needs more training, perhaps even switch out for a different guard. I also asked him twice if we could go in yet, and both times he ignored me. Upon entering the skates were not only stinky but one of the skates my friend received had broken laces? I don‚Äôt know how that was allowed. The ice was honestly really dangerous too. It was very bumpy and had a lot of holes that you could very easily trip on. Crowd control was not that great either, everyone was everywhere made it even more dangerous to skate. Overall it was okay, but would‚Äôve been more stressing if my friends weren‚Äôt distracting me from the chaos.",be look through old photo and come across from when i skate mid december get remind about how bad my skate experience first while line up witness the guard very rudely speak to multiple of other customer treat them with no respect unprofessional need more training perhaps even switch out for a different also ask him twice if we could go in yet both time he ignore me upon enter skate be not only stinky but one friend receive have break lace dont know that allow ice honestly really dangerous too it bumpy lot hole you easily trip on crowd control great either everyone everywhere make skate overall okay would have be stressful friend n't distract chaos,2 stars,2024,cebu

"Best place to experience skating, that you dont have to travel far from Cebu.

Expect the following:
1. Weekends and holidays long queue to purchase ticket.
2. Another que to get inside.
3. Shoes are old.
4. If you have big size of your shoes I dont suggest you try skating because their sizes are small and you will not enjoy skating.

What we did, First, fill up the waiver, second while you fall in line for the ticket, someone from your group also will fall in so that when you have the ticket it will be easy for your group to get inside. Visit with a group because it will be fun, rent a locker to keep safe your valuables TIP: put inside your things in one go so that you will not have to open your locker again because it will ask for another coin for you to open again.

Rent a polar bear, if its your first time, you will need it.",best place to experience skate that you dont have travel far from cebu expect the following 1 weekend and holiday long queue purchase ticket 2 another que get inside 3 shoe be old 4 if big size of your i suggest try because their size small will not enjoy what we do first fill up waiver second while fall in line for someone group also so when it be easy visit with a fun rent locker keep safe valuable tip put thing one go open again ask coin polar bear its time need,4 stars,2023,cebu

"It is a must experience, I came in the field without any experience and no training guides, dropped a lot as expected but got a hang of it a little bit after two hours or so.
So far, it was really challenging but super fun, it's a must try.
I would say that I got some leg cramps but that is partly my fault for not paying for the guide training snow bears that are meant for beginners, they were pretty expensive in a whopping 100 peso for rental.
I could say one of the downsides is the somewhat of a lack of maintenance for the Ice skating shoes or whatever they're called, some of them are very dirty and it irritated a bit of my skin allergies.
There's no staff on the field so I'm not sure if there's a lot of safety in mind, probably too sure that all beginners will buy the newbie bears for guidance.
Still a pretty nice experience to have though.
I saw some of the new kids falling over including myself and there's no staff whatsoever to check if they are ok or not and most people wouldn't care and just continue flexing their Skating skills which annoyed me a bit.
The area is also near with Food places so after a long tiring skate you can chill with your family or friends, or with yourself and eat good food.",it be a must experience i come in the field without any and no training guide drop lot as expect but get hang of little bit after two hour or so far be really challenge super fun its try would say that some leg cramp partly my fault for not pay guide snow bear be mean beginner they be pretty expensive whopping 100 peso rental could one downside somewhat lack maintenance ice skating shoe whatever theyre call them very dirty irritate skin allergy theres staff on im sure if safety mind probably too all will buy newbie guidance still nice to have though saw new kid fall over include myself whatsoever check ok most people wouldnt care just continue flex their skill which annoy me area also near with food place long tiring skate you can chill your family friend yourself eat good,4 stars,2023,cebu

"I was a first-timer and preferred not to hire a coach, so the first few rounds were VERY challenging. But the whole experience was fun, except that my feet hurt not because of all the skating but because of the ice skates. I've got no idea why the skates seemed to hurt my feet every time even though I chose the right size.

The place was not very huge and seemed a bit too crowded, maybe because it was on a Saturday. There were loads of children.

At the weekends, you can avail only the Unlimited Skating, no other choices, for PHP420. Make sure to add PHP50 to your budget - for the locker, to make sure your things are in a safe place whilst you skate, for peace of mind. ;)",i be a firsttimer and prefer not to hire coach so the first few round be very challenge but whole experience fun except that my foot hurt because of all skating ice skate get no idea why seem every time even though choose right size place huge bit too crowd maybe it on saturday there load child at weekend you can avail only unlimited other choice for php420 make sure add php50 your budget locker thing be in safe while skate peace mind,4 stars,2019,cebu

"It was okay.

Skating rink was okay. Skating experience was good as they have attendants inside where when they saw you fell or struggling they are kind enough to help you and also teach you the basics. They have coach where you can rent for 30 mins for 200php (if I heard it right). At that time they no longer have available coach.

We paid for 399php per person good for 2 hours (adults and kids), entry is per batch. Since we are not a pro we rented 2 ""polar bears"" for 125php each. It will be like your walking stick to help you during skating. I highly recommend this for first timers like us. Then 50php each locker.

What I don't like here is it seems like they don't prioritize the health protocol. Literally, once you return the skate shoes, helmet, wrist band locker key, I never saw them disinfecting it. (Upon entering nor upon leaving) And they no longer have alcohol in the dispenser. I asked for it twice so I ended up going back to my locker to get my own alcohol.

I don't like how they organize the queue and how they want you to wear skating shoes first before giving your locker key even when you already paid for it. Imagine, putting your things inside the locker walking from the chair to the locker and TAKE NOTE WEARING SKATING SHOES! They should have considered that not all lockers were positioned eye level, what about those lockers at the bottom!? We asked for it before wearing the boots but they declined to give it as probably the locker was just a one time use.

I will give it a 3 star because the kuya who assisted us during skating was really nice and my inaanak enjoyed.",it be okay skate rink experience good as they have attendant inside where when saw you fell or struggle be kind enough to help and also teach the basic coach can rent for 30 min 200php if i hear right at that time no longer available we pay 399php per person 2 hour adult kid entry be batch since not a pro rent polar bear 125php each will be like your walk stick during highly recommend this first timer us then 50php locker what dont here seem prioritize health protocol literally once return skate shoe helmet wrist band key never them disinfect upon enter nor leave alcohol in dispenser ask twice so end up go back my get own how organize queue want wear before give even already imagine put thing from chair take note wear should consider all locker be position eye level about those bottom boot but decline give perhaps just one use 3 star because brother who assist really nice son enjoy,3 stars,2023,megamall

"The staff were really nice, especially the skate rental attendants. The service was exceptional.

The only problem is that none of the skates available for rent (size 9) were sharp. There was zero edge on the blade and clearly have not been sharpened for a long time. Stating on dull blades is a very serious safety issue. If there is no edge on the blade, there is no ability to turn or even balance. This is very dangerous. I would not recommend this business until they have the ability to sharpen the skates.",the staff be really nice especially skate rental attendant service be exceptional only problem be that none of skate available for rent size 9 sharp there zero edge on blade and clearly have not be sharpen a long time state dull blade very serious safety issue if no ability to turn or even balance this dangerous i would recommend business until they sharpen,1 star,2023,megamall

"The Changing/Rest Area needs Improvement!

As a Regular on Sundays, I really hope the shower rooms are modified or converted into changing rooms

When hockey players and figure skaters are crammed in the morning at the registered skaters area, there's overcrowding that happens. Not only that everyone's skate blades, it doesn't matter if you're a figure skater, hockey player or speed skater, the pads are not covered enough to protect everyone's blades

It would be nice to have some privacy while skaters change into their costumes or gear as well. Utilizing the shower/changing room would really help with this problem

Trying this ice skating for the very first time for both of us was so lit. ü§ôüèº

5 Pointers

1st: It was not easy to walk at the ice with the ice skate. Kudos to those who are trying really hard to practice dancing with it, you guys are awesome.
I best suggest to rent a polar bear for a firt timer. It really helps.

2nd: I forgot to bring a jacket with me it was so cold inside the rink. So, I recommend don't forget to bring one jacket with you guys.

3rd: For you to enjoy the moment try to copy-cat the others. I swear, it can help you to move slowly but surely.

4th: Don't forget to record a video clip when you are a first timer. I bet you, it will makes your jaw and belly hurt due to laughing hard. Record every moment and have fun.

5th: Don't forget to take a photo and slay your ice skate. As if you've never been through many struggles strolling with it. ‚õ∏",we have so much fun celebrate our 7th year anniversary here at megamall ice skate rink last 02162020 try this for the very first time both of us be lit 5 pointer 1st it not easy to walk with skate kudos those who be really hard practice dance you guy awesome i best suggest rent a polar bear firt timer help 2nd forget bring jacket me cold inside recommend dont forget one 3rd enjoy moment try copycat others swear can help move slowly but surely 4th record video clip when bet will make your jaw and belly hurt due laugh every have 5th take photo slay as if 've never be through many struggle stroll,5 stars,2020,megamall
"They have cut off even if you are paying for unlimited ice skating. On weekends, if you arrive at 1pm, there's tendency that your time in will be 3:15pm. If you have a 2-hr ticket (limited time), chances are, you'll be at 3:00 or 5:30 batch. With the long lines coming in, plus long lines in getting shoes, and wearing it, you will start to skate at around 3:30 or 3:45pm. They will ask you to leave the ice at 4:30 to resurface the rink and your time will end at 5:00 pm (so, that's basically 1 hour only, not 2hrs!). They will not let you come in anymore after they clean the rink. Lockers are for one time use (one open and one close), they will lock your locker and confiscate your things if you opened it for any reasons at all. If you rest and take off your ice skating shoes, they will confiscate the shoes (no shoes on the floor), and you need to fall in line again to get one (long lines during cleaning period).

"I went at 6 o'clock on a Saturday and couldn't get in because I didn't have enough shoes.
I went at 6pm on Sunday and was told to go in at 7:30.
There is a 2-hour pass and a day pass, and 2 hours is enough to ride.
If you get a 2-hour pass, you'll have to wait if you don't go on time, so it's better to go on time.
Times and fees are attached with photos.

Temperature - It was short-sleeved shorts and it wasn't cold at all. I was almost sweating. There doesn't seem to be a need to bring thick clothes.

Shoes - There were no sizes 10 and 11, so I wore size 12. There is a size measuring machine so you don't have to find out in advance. And if you go at 5 or 7 o'clock, your shoes may be dirty and wet because other people wore them at the previous time.

Lockers - I ordered a 2-hour pass for two people, and lockers were automatically included in the receipt. 50 pesos is automatically added.
First, I had to put my shoes and bag in, but it was full after I put in one backpack. I went into the skating rink with my bag and got kicked out. You cannot carry bags inside. If you have a lot of luggage, buy more lockers.

Polar Bear - Hold and ride is a tool for beginners. It's 100 pesos per hour, but no one cares about the time. And because there are not enough numbers, if you rent it late, you have to wait with a waiting number.
They are also made so that you can sit on Polar Bear's lap, and although they are all different sizes, they are the same price. I rented a small one and couldn't even sit on it, so I ended up replacing it later. They say I can't exchange it with other people, but I still don't understand.

People - Most people are not good at riding. And there are about 10 to 20% of people who are very good at riding, and they seem to be aspiring athletes or practicing professionals. The receptionists were not friendly.",i go at 6 oclock on a saturday and could n't get in because do have enough shoe 6pm sunday be tell to go 730 there be 2hour pas day 2 hour ride if you youll wait dont time so its better time fee be attach with photo temperature it shortsleeved short wasnt cold all almost sweat doesnt seem be need bring thick clothes be no size 10 11 wear size 12 measuring machine find out advance 5 or 7 your may dirty wet other people them the previous locker order hour for two automatically include receipt 50 peso add first have put my bag but full after one backpack into skate rink get kick can not carry bag inside lot of luggage buy more polar bear hold tool beginner 100 per care about number rent late wait number they also make that sit bear lap although different same price rent small couldnt even end up replace later say cant exchange still understand most good rid 20 who very aspire athlete practice professional . receptionist friendly,3 stars,2023,megamall

"Ambience: the place is festive and properly lit. We went in as part of the first batch of the 2 hour pass, so the rink is not crowded.

"We came here(MOA) to try out ice skating in the Philippines. According to my daughter, the rental skates are big and heavy and the blades are dull. The alternative is to rent hockey skates for an hour at over 400 pesos. My son said the blades on the hockey skates, an old pair of Bauer Vapors, are also dull.  Admission is about 500 pesos for a full day. That means you can skate for a while, then take off and come back later to skate. The rink closes when the mall closes.
We did not see any facility for sharpening skates.
There was a hockey practice at 8:30pm but weren‚Äôt allowed to watch it.
We asked if there‚Äôs a Zamboni and were told that there is one. We never saw it though. The ice rink is currently located on the third floor of MOA. I think it was originally on the ground floor. So I doubt that the ice is resurfaced at all.
