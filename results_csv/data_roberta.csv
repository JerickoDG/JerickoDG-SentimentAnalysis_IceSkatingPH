"They have time slots to choose from. Food stalls nearby. There was a waiver form you need to fill which the cashier forgot to tell us that we eventually found out when we were about to get our skating shoes. It was a bit chaotic when we were inside to get our skating shoes. There was no proper line and some would just cut in line probably because they are excited to get to the rink. There are also extra fees for the bear, locker and socks. The socks cost about 50 pesos and they say its important to buy if the socks you're wearing does not cover until your calves because people could get rash due to many people using the shoes. Helmets are not sturdy and smelly due to sweat from previous user. But I'm in for the experience so I just shrug off my whole chaotic encounter.

"Was looking through old photos and came across photos from when I skated mid December and got reminded about how bad my skating experience was‚Ä¶ first, while lining up, I witnessed the guard very rudely speak to multiple of the other customers and treat them with no respect. Very unprofessional needs more training, perhaps even switch out for a different guard. I also asked him twice if we could go in yet, and both times he ignored me. Upon entering the skates were not only stinky but one of the skates my friend received had broken laces? I don‚Äôt know how that was allowed. The ice was honestly really dangerous too. It was very bumpy and had a lot of holes that you could very easily trip on. Crowd control was not that great either, everyone was everywhere made it even more dangerous to skate.

"Best place to experience skating, that you dont have to travel far from Cebu.

1. Weekends and holidays long queue to purchase ticket.
2. Another que to get inside.
3. Shoes are old.
4. If you have big size of your shoes I dont suggest you try skating because their sizes are small and you will not enjoy skating.

Visit with a group because it will be fun, rent a locker to keep safe your valuables TIP: put inside your things in one go so that you will not have to open your locker again because it will ask for another coin for you to open again.

"It is a must experience, I came in the field without any experience and no training guides, dropped a lot as expected but got a hang of it a little bit after two hours or so.
So far, it was really challenging but super fun, it's a must try.
I would say that I got some leg cramps but that is partly my fault for not paying for the guide training snow bears that are meant for beginners, they were pretty expensive in a whopping 100 peso for rental.
I could say one of the downsides is the somewhat of a lack of maintenance for the Ice skating shoes or whatever they're called, some of them are very dirty and it irritated a bit of my skin allergies.
There's no staff on the field so I'm not sure if there's a lot of safety in mind, probably too sure that all beginners will buy the newbie bears for guidance.
Still a pretty nice experience to have though.
I saw some of the new kids falling over including myself and there's no staff whatsoever to check if they are ok or not and most people wouldn't care and just continue flexing their Skating skills which annoyed me a bit.

The rink itself is well-maintained, with smooth ice that facilitates easy gliding. Skating here is a breeze, and the spacious layout ensures that even during peak hours, you won't feel too crowded.

For those looking to improve their skills, the rink occasionally offers lessons, making it accessible for beginners eager to learn the ropes.

One downside might be the occasional long lines during peak hours, but the wait is generally worth it once you hit the ice. The ticket prices are reasonable, making it a cost-effective activity for a day out.

Overall, the SM Megamall Skating Rink provides a delightful experience for skaters of all levels.

"It was okay.

Skating rink was okay. Skating experience was good as they have attendants inside where when they saw you fell or struggling they are kind enough to help you and also teach you the basics. They have coach where you can rent for 30 mins for 200php (if I heard it right). At that time they no longer have available coach.

We paid for 399php per person good for 2 hours (adults and kids), entry is per batch. Since we are not a pro we rented 2 ""polar bears"" for 125php each. It will be like your walking stick to help you during skating. I highly recommend this for first timers like us. Then 50php each locker.

What I don't like here is it seems like they don't prioritize the health protocol. Literally, once you return the skate shoes, helmet, wrist band locker key, I never saw them disinfecting it. (Upon entering nor upon leaving) And they no longer have alcohol in the dispenser. I asked for it twice so I ended up going back to my locker to get my own alcohol.

I don't like how they organize the queue and how they want you to wear skating shoes first before giving your locker key even when you already paid for it. Imagine, putting your things inside the locker walking from the chair to the locker and TAKE NOTE WEARING SKATING SHOES! They should have considered that not all lockers were positioned eye level, what about those lockers at the bottom!? We asked for it before wearing the boots but they declined to give it as probably the locker was just a one time use.

I will give it a 3 star because the kuya who assisted us during skating was really nice and my inaanak enjoyed.",it be okay skate rink experience good as they have attendant inside where when saw you fell or struggle be kind enough to help and also teach the basic coach can rent for 30 min 200php if i hear right at that time no longer available we pay 399php per person 2 hour adult kid entry be batch since not a pro rent polar bear 125php each will be like your walk stick during highly recommend this first timer us then 50php locker what dont here seem prioritize health protocol literally once return skate shoe helmet wrist band key never them disinfect upon enter nor leave alcohol in dispenser ask twice so end up go back my get own how organize queue want wear before give even already imagine put thing from chair take note wear should consider all locker be position eye level about those bottom boot but decline give perhaps just one use 3 star because brother who assist really nice son enjoy,3 stars,2023,megamall,"{'neg': 0.018588094, 'neu': 0.32117313, 'pos': 0.6602388}",0.018588094,0.32117313,0.6602388,positive

"The Changing/Rest Area needs Improvement!

As a Regular on Sundays, I really hope the shower rooms are modified or converted into changing rooms

When hockey players and figure skaters are crammed in the morning at the registered skaters area, there's overcrowding that happens. Not only that everyone's skate blades, it doesn't matter if you're a figure skater, hockey player or speed skater, the pads are not covered enough to protect everyone's blades

It would be nice to have some privacy while skaters change into their costumes or gear as well. Utilizing the shower/changing room would really help with this problem

1st: It was not easy to walk at the ice with the ice skate. Kudos to those who are trying really hard to practice dancing with it, you guys are awesome.
I best suggest to rent a polar bear for a firt timer. It really helps.

2nd: I forgot to bring a jacket with me it was so cold inside the rink. So, I recommend don't forget to bring one jacket with you guys.

3rd: For you to enjoy the moment try to copy-cat the others. I swear, it can help you to move slowly but surely.

4th: Don't forget to record a video clip when you are a first timer. I bet you, it will makes your jaw and belly hurt due to laughing hard. Record every moment and have fun.

5th: Don't forget to take a photo and slay your ice skate.

"I went at 6 o'clock on a Saturday and couldn't get in because I didn't have enough shoes.
I went at 6pm on Sunday and was told to go in at 7:30.
There is a 2-hour pass and a day pass, and 2 hours is enough to ride.
If you get a 2-hour pass, you'll have to wait if you don't go on time, so it's better to go on time.
Times and fees are attached with photos.

Temperature - It was short-sleeved shorts and it wasn't cold at all. I was almost sweating. There doesn't seem to be a need to bring thick clothes.

Shoes - There were no sizes 10 and 11, so I wore size 12. There is a size measuring machine so you don't have to find out in advance. And if you go at 5 or 7 o'clock, your shoes may be dirty and wet because other people wore them at the previous time.

Lockers - I ordered a 2-hour pass for two people, and lockers were automatically included in the receipt. 50 pesos is automatically added.
First, I had to put my shoes and bag in, but it was full after I put in one backpack. I went into the skating rink with my bag and got kicked out. You cannot carry bags inside. If you have a lot of luggage, buy more lockers.

Polar Bear - Hold and ride is a tool for beginners. It's 100 pesos per hour, but no one cares about the time. And because there are not enough numbers, if you rent it late, you have to wait with a waiting number.
They are also made so that you can sit on Polar Bear's lap, and although they are all different sizes, they are the same price. I rented a small one and couldn't even sit on it, so I ended up replacing it later. They say I can't exchange it with other people, but I still don't understand.

People - Most people are not good at riding. And there are about 10 to 20% of people who are very good at riding, and they seem to be aspiring athletes or practicing professionals.
