"They have time slots to choose from. Food stalls nearby. There was a waiver form you need to fill which the cashier forgot to tell us that we eventually found out when we were about to get our skating shoes. It was a bit chaotic when we were inside to get our skating shoes. There was no proper line and some would just cut in line probably because they are excited to get to the rink. There are also extra fees for the bear, locker and socks. The socks cost about 50 pesos and they say its important to buy if the socks you're wearing does not cover until your calves because people could get rash due to many people using the shoes. Helmets are not sturdy and smelly due to sweat from previous user. But I'm in for the experience so I just shrug off my whole chaotic encounter. There were figure skaters practicing and playing around at the rink too so it was entertaining to watch.",4 stars,2024,cebu
"Was looking through old photos and came across photos from when I skated mid December and got reminded about how bad my skating experience was‚Ä¶ first, while lining up, I witnessed the guard very rudely speak to multiple of the other customers and treat them with no respect. Very unprofessional needs more training, perhaps even switch out for a different guard. I also asked him twice if we could go in yet, and both times he ignored me. Upon entering the skates were not only stinky but one of the skates my friend received had broken laces? I don‚Äôt know how that was allowed. The ice was honestly really dangerous too. It was very bumpy and had a lot of holes that you could very easily trip on. Crowd control was not that great either, everyone was everywhere made it even more dangerous to skate. Overall it was okay, but would‚Äôve been more stressing if my friends weren‚Äôt distracting me from the chaos.",2 stars,2024,cebu
"it was fun and enjoyable went here with the love of my life heeheh naa pd mga instructor and skating students it was too nice to see. One thing I despise kay they gave me a really worn out skating shoes and ohab kaayoo ü•πü•πü•π I guess I do not have a choice??? Lain sd kaayo mamili ko na mao na may gihatag. Either way, I had fun ans thats what matters",3 stars,2024,cebu
"I gave it two star because of the skating shoes is super old, it's not sharp enough, and the entrance smell feet . The floor in ice skating area has alot of bumps so bit disappointing , can cause accidents especially for the beginners and children.
But at the end still have fun.
Entrance fee is 330 good for 2 hours.",2 stars,2023,cebu
"Check the picture for the latest price as of March 2024.

Enjoy kaayo!!!",5 stars,2024,cebu
"The experience was fun, but the skating shoes were so old and dull hope you could upgrade them... also there's portions of the ice that is very bad it could cause accidents. The bump cars compromises the space of the public skaters and also for the enrolled figure skaters considering the high price you have to pay for the entrance. The regular guard is so rude, so unapproachable and disrespectful, needs more training.",1 star,2024,cebu
"Long queue to get and pay the ticket, other people are inserting pretending to get a waiver form!!! no strict compliance, no social distancing üò¢ After paying the ticket another long queue to get inside the ice skating. It could be good if the ticket can be purchase online so no need to queue twice. ‚Ä¶",3 stars,2023,cebu
My first time and I'm scared but I enjoyed it  üòÅ ‚Ä¶,5 stars,2024,cebu
they have scheduled times for in and outs so i would highly suggest checking it out first to plan ahead bc it tends to get a bit busy. we dont rlly know how to skate and just went there for the experience and also to try out ice skating. enjoyed it but we only got to skate for less than 30minutes (we got a 2hr pass) bc our feet are hurting already lol. the skating shoes are a bit old alrdy but ofc still usable.,4 stars,2023,cebu
"Best place to experience skating, that you dont have to travel far from Cebu.

Expect the following:
1. Weekends and holidays long queue to purchase ticket.
2. Another que to get inside.
3. Shoes are old.
4. If you have big size of your shoes I dont suggest you try skating because their sizes are small and you will not enjoy skating.

What we did, First, fill up the waiver, second while you fall in line for the ticket, someone from your group also will fall in so that when you have the ticket it will be easy for your group to get inside. Visit with a group because it will be fun, rent a locker to keep safe your valuables TIP: put inside your things in one go so that you will not have to open your locker again because it will ask for another coin for you to open again.

Rent a polar bear, if its your first time, you will need it.",4 stars,2023,cebu
Sm Ice skating is located in upper floor Sm seaside. Many young people come here for play. but it need to line and waiting. Price for 2 hour is 300p. Very nice experience must try!!,5 stars,2023,cebu
"It is a must experience, I came in the field without any experience and no training guides, dropped a lot as expected but got a hang of it a little bit after two hours or so.
So far, it was really challenging but super fun, it's a must try.
I would say that I got some leg cramps but that is partly my fault for not paying for the guide training snow bears that are meant for beginners, they were pretty expensive in a whopping 100 peso for rental.
I could say one of the downsides is the somewhat of a lack of maintenance for the Ice skating shoes or whatever they're called, some of them are very dirty and it irritated a bit of my skin allergies.
There's no staff on the field so I'm not sure if there's a lot of safety in mind, probably too sure that all beginners will buy the newbie bears for guidance.
Still a pretty nice experience to have though.
I saw some of the new kids falling over including myself and there's no staff whatsoever to check if they are ok or not and most people wouldn't care and just continue flexing their Skating skills which annoyed me a bit.
The area is also near with Food places so after a long tiring skate you can chill with your family or friends, or with yourself and eat good food.",4 stars,2023,cebu
Great experience ice skating in SM Seaside Cebu City.,5 stars,2024,cebu
Nice place to spend with family. I enjoyed learning how to iceskate (or icewalk) üòÅ with my kids. Core memory for our family ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Ä¶,5 stars,2023,cebu
"FUN IN ICE.  I always visit this place because my 6- year old loves to skate on ice.  The rink is very spacious. They have plenty of watchers who will constantly ensure that the rules in the place are followed. As long as my daughter loves this, I love this, too.",5 stars,2020,cebu
"The reason why I gave 4 stars its because the SM ICE SKATING RINK should include in their Fee - a short Tutorial and Guide/Assistance for FIRST TIMERS. Nevertheless, the service and staff are great. Though there are limited snacks inside though. The SM Ice Skating Rink is a perfect place for your dream Ice Skating experience. They have a 30-minute Ice Resurfacing Schedule at various timelines of the day.",4 stars,2020,cebu
"I was a first-timer and preferred not to hire a coach, so the first few rounds were VERY challenging. But the whole experience was fun, except that my feet hurt not because of all the skating but because of the ice skates. I've got no idea why the skates seemed to hurt my feet every time even though I chose the right size.

The place was not very huge and seemed a bit too crowded, maybe because it was on a Saturday. There were loads of children.

At the weekends, you can avail only the Unlimited Skating, no other choices, for PHP420. Make sure to add PHP50 to your budget - for the locker, to make sure your things are in a safe place whilst you skate, for peace of mind. ;)",4 stars,2019,cebu
We love to visit here with my family and friends. We enjoy skating to relax and enjoy.,5 stars,2023,cebu
I would highly suggest the people should just go on one direction either clockwise or counterclockwise so that people will not clash. That is how it's done in UK so that no one will clash and the professionals can skate round in the middle in the same direction.,2 stars,2024,cebu
"It was my first time to try ice skating and it was hard to do in actual rather than just thinking on how to do it. But anyone can get better on it with constant practice and training with the application of basics. The location is a great place to experience actual ice skating. And also a great place and time to bond with family, friends and loved ones.",5 stars,2020,cebu
"Fun for all ages. 2 hours or daily passes. Daily passes offer the best value. On fire skates rental, included. Locker, polar bear (to hold on to if you don't know how to skate) and instructors are extra. Food court nearby, benches for those who don't skate and just want to watch.
Good place to burn some energy.",4 stars,2023,cebu
"It is a fun filled way to spend time and go active

It is a way to feel you are not in a tropical country anymore  affordable and even has a bear stand or assist for beginners that cant balance yet for 100 pesos

You can also get a skating coach .",5 stars,2020,cebu
"It's nice to enjoy , but they need to get new shoe laces for the ice skates other than that I recommend you go before noon otherwise it will be very crowded",5 stars,2023,cebu
Had a lot of fuuuun. Me and my friends got to avail 250.00 on a weekday at 7p-9p. Twas really fun.,5 stars,2020,cebu
"I was shocked to see NOBODY skating at 7pm, only to find out that their basic rate is 420 pesos for unlimited hours! Their skate shoes are hard, way too hard that my bunions got swollen in just 10mins. But either way, I had fun skating even though their ice was old and frosty and some parts are uneven.",2 stars,2019,cebu
Great ice skating. Love it !,5 stars,2023,cebu
A whole lot of fun for the kids but they are quite a bit pricier than a movie and they don't appear to have per hour rates. They haven't maintained their stock of available sizes. Quite a number of sizes were unavailable early in the day and they don't sell skates in the shop.,3 stars,2017,cebu
"Went to play here last 2019 before COVID and went there again recently, its much better now since its not that crowded as it used to be. The staff are there and alert to watch over any injuries. We didn't have that much fun since we didnt know how to skate and didn't ""rent"" a coach. We just went to try it and overall it was fun. A little pricey though but fun.",4 stars,2023,cebu
"Thank you so much to the staff!! I accidentally left my tablet on the comfort room after we went ice skating. They were very kind and helpful to me when I went back to ask if they have it. Thank you so much! You guys were definitely heros especially in terms of my grades since my school documents are in said tab haha. Again, thank you!! Also a massive thank you to the unknown customer who turned over my tab when they found it! You guys are life savers huhu

And the ice skating itself was fun haha thanks. A great place to bond with friends, family, and your date!",5 stars,2023,cebu
An international standard ice skating rink.  Good for everyone.,5 stars,2019,cebu
Great activity for Kids,5 stars,2024,cebu
"The place itself is nice, though I don't think they disinfect the shoes thoroughly after someone has used them as they smell bad. Their largest shoes are only a size 9 or something which were way too small for me (I have size 10.5 feet) so my feet were cramped and got really sore after the session.",3 stars,2020,cebu
Cold. And best for kids who have nothing else to do..,4 stars,2020,cebu
"Good place to have fun with your kids, they will love it. Only daytickets for 420php, no by hour offers, kids are tired after 1hour! Small lockers which you can open only one time for 50php!!, most disturbing was the really loud music, hardly understood my son when he talked to me, ice quality good.",2 stars,2018,cebu
"I love skating. This is the best hobby that I found and I skate for the first time in 2017. The unlimited skating is P420, but pay P500 or P1000 and the locker is only P50, cheaper. But last June, I had an incident, I slided when driving and fighting in polar bears and I am only unlimited, I choose that I wouldn't have a polar bear because it is expensived. In other words, the skating rink has a cleaning time in every skating.",5 stars,2020,cebu
"Great place to have fun with your friends. For those first timers I recommend you guys to use the polar bears (which is 100 per hour).
I only give 4 stars because you're not allowed to bring food. If you're hungry u have to buy your food from their snack stall which is kinda expensive",4 stars,2019,cebu
Good experience!,5 stars,2023,cebu
Good,5 stars,2023,cebu
"Very good place for kids and kids at heart. At P450 for unlimited skating, you can skate all you want. They also offer figure skating and ice hockey lessons.

Good thing it‚Äôs right across the Foodcourt in case the kids get hungry or thirsty.

This is our go to place whenever we have to wait for other family members to finish shopping or having their nails done. We sit in the bleachers enjoying the antics of the skaters while doing FB, texting or doing puzzles to pass the time. Then it‚Äôs time to go home. :)",5 stars,2019,cebu
My kids favorite. Go for the unlimited time for a price of 450 pesos it's all worth it. Kids will enjoy more and they will have more time to practice skating and make friends with other skaters there.,4 stars,2019,cebu
"At 61 Im a bit old to get on the ice skates but our kids sure had a great time.  It was a fun day watching them learning to ice skate.   The staff was very helpful as they were being sized for skates.

To help they have these Polar Bear stabilizers that the kids push around the rink to help them get their ice legs.   I have never seen those before but it sure helped them stay steady for their first time.

Shout out to the Squid Snack kiosc just across from them.  Squid snacks are amazing,  they the BBQ and Spicey.",5 stars,2020,cebu
SM Skating Ring is located in SM Seaside at 3rd Floor in Cyber Zone area. It's really exciting if you are a beginner to use the skating board. There's a staff to teach you how to skate. Whether you are adult or teen there's no matter since this is just an experience for you to play in the ice rink. Spend your holiday time together with your family to watch or to skate in the ice.

Come on & visit the SM Skating & relax together with your family to experiece the thrill of how to skate he!he!he! . GOD Bless & enjoy.,5 stars,2020,cebu
"Great location, but skates were quite blunt and needed more sharpening. Was told they are sharpened every 6 months but really should be more often, especially since used so much.",3 stars,2020,cebu
"The skating rink is high quality and well maintained. It offers lockers, instructors and even a polar bear shaped skating aid. Will come back often.

Payment ‚Ç±380 for unlimited skating",5 stars,2017,cebu
"When you're next in line to pay, the staff let's other groups cut in front of you.",1 star,2023,cebu
Fun skating rink. Good size with assistance when needed. Prices are quite high with only unlimited skating offered most of the time. Could do with an hourly/session rate.,5 stars,2019,cebu
Fun place to learn ice skating in Cebu... in fact the ONLY ice rink in Cebu. They have awesome coaches and good equipment. The only problem is the ice tends to have a lot of bumps (due to water dropping from the ceiling) which caused serious injury to some people,4 stars,2020,cebu
Best Ice skating in Cebu,4 stars,2024,cebu
"Good fun to ice skate in tropics. They sale glove, rent helmet and some sliding bears for beginners. Ice well organized. Really had a great time",5 stars,2020,cebu

"Very quiet
I went with a child who was skating for the first time, and he was proud that he was able to skate on his own because there was a device he could hold on to. Of course, he said he was good at riding alone and gave me a seal applause.

Ice quality is not good
Adults say it's a bit chilly in shorts and shorts, and children say it's a bit cold. Long pants required. Socks required. Be careful to enter at the skating time, every 2 hours.",3 stars,2024,cebu
"The all-day ticket was 599 pesos. Perhaps because of the price range, more people purchase the 2-hour ticket, but even though it was the weekend and there were a lot of people, it was still worth the ride. You can only use Polar Bear for 1 hour and the locker costs 50 pesos, but since it is one time, the staff will add 5 pesos if you need to open and close it again.",5 stars,2023,cebu
"The ice surface is good, but the skates are in poor condition. They stink, are uncomfortable and pretty broken.
My feet hurt and I couldn't enjoy skating.",3 stars,2024,cebu
"It is a little smaller than Busan Shinsegae Ice Rink.
The ice doesn't melt and it's cool.
Rental skates smell and the blades are badly worn.
There are a lot of slips between guests.",3 stars,2023,cebu
"A must try experience. More is better. Muscle pain is sure to be the star tomorrow. lol
But it's worth it. There are lockers for rent so don't worry about your valuables. Leave your mobile phones to avoid accidents. Enjoy the moment. Even if there is no picture, it's ok than breaking your phone. Enjoy skating.",5 stars,2019,cebu
"It's fun, but the disadvantage is that the shoes are a bit dirty and smelly.",4 stars,2023,cebu
"If you go at the first time, it is not crowded and you can use it. The quality of the ice is uneven, but it is enough to keep you cool in hot countries.",4 stars,2023,cebu

"Title: Glide and Chill at SM Megamall Skating Rink

The SM Megamall Skating Rink offers a cool escape from the bustling mall atmosphere, providing a fun and energetic experience for both beginners and seasoned skaters alike.

The rink itself is well-maintained, with smooth ice that facilitates easy gliding. Skating here is a breeze, and the spacious layout ensures that even during peak hours, you won't feel too crowded.

The rink's ambiance is vibrant, complemented by upbeat music that adds to the overall enjoyment. It's an ideal spot for friends and families to gather, offering a blend of recreation and exercise. For those looking to improve their skills, the rink occasionally offers lessons, making it accessible for beginners eager to learn the ropes.

One downside might be the occasional long lines during peak hours, but the wait is generally worth it once you hit the ice. The ticket prices are reasonable, making it a cost-effective activity for a day out.

Overall, the SM Megamall Skating Rink provides a delightful experience for skaters of all levels. Whether you're looking for a casual outing or a more serious skate session, this rink offers an enjoyable escape within the heart of the mall. Lace up your skates and glide away for a refreshing and entertaining time.",5 stars,2024,megamall
"Its so happy to skate here because sometimes there's disco here, also people here enjoying their time and can get some friends",5 stars,2023,megamall
This is a pretty big skating rink at first I thought it was small but after getting up close and getting inside and experiencing it it is very large. It‚Äôs better to come Monday through Friday where you can have a little more space on the weekends this place is beyond packed I mean jam packed and for the line is out the door around the building on the weekends. However a very nice addition they do have a set of bleachers to sit on or in while you watch your company ice skate I would say there‚Äôs about 12 to 15 rows and then there‚Äôs two sets Bleachers which is really accommodating so I have to give them a higher star then I was going to just because of that. Also their prices are pretty fair not too bad for Large City and such a large skating rink. Teresa skating rink you will need to go all the way to the very top floor that‚Äôs where it is located.,5 stars,2023,megamall
"It was okay.

Skating rink was okay. Skating experience was good as they have attendants inside where when they saw you fell or struggling they are kind enough to help you and also teach you the basics. They have coach where you can rent for 30 mins for 200php (if I heard it right). At that time they no longer have available coach.

We paid for 399php per person good for 2 hours (adults and kids), entry is per batch. Since we are not a pro we rented 2 ""polar bears"" for 125php each. It will be like your walking stick to help you during skating. I highly recommend this for first timers like us. Then 50php each locker.

What I don't like here is it seems like they don't prioritize the health protocol. Literally, once you return the skate shoes, helmet, wrist band locker key, I never saw them disinfecting it. (Upon entering nor upon leaving) And they no longer have alcohol in the dispenser. I asked for it twice so I ended up going back to my locker to get my own alcohol.

I don't like how they organize the queue and how they want you to wear skating shoes first before giving your locker key even when you already paid for it. Imagine, putting your things inside the locker walking from the chair to the locker and TAKE NOTE WEARING SKATING SHOES! They should have considered that not all lockers were positioned eye level, what about those lockers at the bottom!? We asked for it before wearing the boots but they declined to give it as probably the locker was just a one time use.

I will give it a 3 star because the kuya who assisted us during skating was really nice and my inaanak enjoyed.",3 stars,2023,megamall
"Very poor process. Its already 2023 and they are still not digitalized. It takes more than 1hr just to pay and another 1hr at least before you can enter. The line is ao long, there are 3 cashiers but only one is working. If you have kids, one adult is required to go inside and have to pay for no reason even though your kids can do it by themselves as they have experience in ice skating already. We even bought tickets online but you still need to queue as they said official tickets have to be redeemed in the counter. Buying tickets online is useless!!! Very disappointed.",1 star,2023,megamall
"Aug 2022: They are super organized now than before. From the lockers down to the polar bear rental, everything is in order. They limit the entry of people every 2 hours. That's why the ice skating rink is not that crowded. Kudos to the management and staff for making said changes. Good job!!! üëèüèª üëèüèªüëèüèª

Mar 2023: They are super organized and they also have Friday Disco On Ice üòä The only downside is that the skating shoes are in bad condition and it has a terrible smell. Hopefully, they can address this issue ASAP. They also have Taters food stall inside.",4 stars,2023,megamall
"Went to buy ticket at around 2PM however the next scheduled time to go inside the rink would be 5PM. Process was smooth to get the skating shoes for our sizes and locker. When it's time to get inside the rink, I noticed that the rink seems a bit damp/wet. I remember when I was younger that whenever we go to the old skating rink from SM Megamall that the ice is dry and it doesn't have any water forming inside the rink. And I feel that it's easier to skate if the ice looks dry and not wet.",3 stars,2023,megamall
"The staff were really nice, especially the skate rental attendants. The service was exceptional.

The only problem is that none of the skates available for rent (size 9) were sharp. There was zero edge on the blade and clearly have not been sharpened for a long time. Stating on dull blades is a very serious safety issue. If there is no edge on the blade, there is no ability to turn or even balance. This is very dangerous. I would not recommend this business until they have the ability to sharpen the skates.",1 star,2023,megamall
"Rink is decent but the iceskates are often broken and terribly stanky. They dont clean the skates between clients (as far as we could tell) so its quite disgusting.
Staff is very helpful and friendly though.",4 stars,2024,megamall
"It was my first time trying, and I am happy about it. Definitely will go back and try again. It was hard to learn and felt down many times (part of it and enjoyed it).

The shoes are not clean and smelly, I recommend bringing extra socks in advance. And you can buy your ticket online, which is much cheaper on the metrodeal website.",4 stars,2023,megamall
"Happy now body ache later ü§£ü§£ü§£.
One of the best experience this year, worth it to try.",5 stars,2023,megamall
"Grumpy, unhelpful salespeople.  Didn't have the shoe size I confirmed in advance they had.  Show up an hour later...someone in front of me grabs the last (only?) Pair of size 9s.  Like, really???  On a Tuesday 2pm when school is in session.  What's it like on a weekend, or holiday break?

You are in a megamall, and you have ONE pair of 9s?  Lol... amateur hour here at the ""greatest"" mall on the Philippines.  More like the laziest.

How difficult can it possibly be to have EXTRA on hand just in case...like any other normally functioning business would. Pathetic.",1 star,2024,megamall
"Skates stink so bad and are so dull (hard to glide in) theyre in such bad shape overall. I dont like the timeslot system either because they take so long to process the line. Lockers are also required but so unsystematic and some of the ice marshalls are so rude! Lastly, they post special scheds in advance but dont even follow them!",1 star,2024,megamall
Been there with my siblings. Its friday night kaya madaming tao pero super enjoy. Memorable experience for a first timer hehe,5 stars,2023,megamall
A very fun experience. A good place to hang out with friends and family. Don't forget to bring your sweater because its so cold inside. They also have variety of shoe sizes so everyone has a fit.,5 stars,2019,megamall
"The Changing/Rest Area needs Improvement!

As a Regular on Sundays, I really hope the shower rooms are modified or converted into changing rooms

When hockey players and figure skaters are crammed in the morning at the registered skaters area, there's overcrowding that happens. Not only that everyone's skate blades, it doesn't matter if you're a figure skater, hockey player or speed skater, the pads are not covered enough to protect everyone's blades

It would be nice to have some privacy while skaters change into their costumes or gear as well. Utilizing the shower/changing room would really help with this problem

The Ice
Maybe it's the weather, but those spiky metal sheets on the ceiling are creating water droplets that make the ice really bad. Maybe it's time to remove the metal sheets from the ceiling and replace them with something more practical?",3 stars,2023,megamall
"Healing my inner child!

Tip: bring alcohol or sanitizer. The shoes could be smelly.",5 stars,2023,megamall
"Skating rink was not as smooth as it was sadt. The skating has new instructions where you could only skate in one direction - counterclockwise. Removes the fun out of the freestyle. Hahaha also there are a lot of people when we skate and seems that it was overcrowded especially on the sides handle.

Anyways, we tried the 2hrs instead of the unli hours. It's enough amount of time because you'll get exhausted easily of you're a beginner. Locker room rental for your valuables and shoes are php50. The shoes are not new and bring thicker socks so that you won't wound yourself in the shoes aglet metal holes inside.

Good for beginners who would like to have fun.",3 stars,2023,megamall
"Spacious place to skate and good for beginners. The ice is not that smooth so be careful. The shoes are ‚Äúsmelly‚Äù from overused I think. There are a lot of people there specially on peak days (weekends).

Rate is 450php unlimited skating
100php for the Polar Bear rental (1hour) - this will help you to balance while skating

50php for the locker rental

Overall, this is a good place to have fun with friends.",3 stars,2019,megamall
"Fun place for the kids.  Regular rate of p450 and they promo for p250 during weekdays.
The shoes tend to be old and smelly.  But the kids dont seem to mind.

Big space.. we had so much fun and will definitely come back.,5 stars,2023,megamall
"DO NOT COME HERE WITH YOUR KID!
Skate blade is terrible, zero edge on their blade. I would not recommend you bring your family or kids here.
This is very dangerous because the shoes cannot provide enough support.
Is a ankle breaker. is really painful every second.

It was disappointed that size 9 is the most popular one but SM not prepare enough.",1 star,2023,megamall
"Serviceable skating rink.  The ice is a bit rough due to the number of people and they only service it twice a day.  Even after the zamboni smoothed the ice, it wasn't the quality of surface I am used to.  The quality of the skates weren't up to standards as well.  But for beginners and first timers, this rink will do.",3 stars,2018,megamall
It was super nice. You have to get there early so you don't have to wait in line. They have 2 hour rent and an all day pass.,4 stars,2023,megamall
"Cool place, but check because they have time limits. And also locker is one time use only(u can open and close it only once). So if you gonna share it, keep in mind it.",5 stars,2023,megamall
"I'm a big fan of ice skating. We usually ice skate at SM MOA but had to go here because my friend is nearer here in Megamall.

I'm a bit disappointed. Because there's too many people,we had to fall in line for like 30 minutes just to get the ice skates.. the rink is smaller compared to MOAs and the worst part is the shoes smells so bad. In Mall of Asia, it's not like this.",2 stars,2023,megamall
Went here on a Thursday before lunch with friends. Not much people and pretty large skating rink considering it is inside a mall.,5 stars,2023,megamall
"Had fun, but check ur schedule bcoz they have time limits. You can also rent a locker & a polar bear which you can use to stand or a guide & you can borrow helmet for free.",4 stars,2023,megamall
Great place to learn skates. But one of the problems i faced are the coaches of the figure skaters. They get mad at customers for obstructing but those customers are begginers and cannot help obstructing. But essentially good quality of rink and they periodically clean the rink. Some shoes smell by the way,3 stars,2017,megamall
"We had so much fun Celebrating our 7th year anniversary here at Megamall Ice Skating Rink last 02/16/2020.

Trying this ice skating for the very first time for both of us was so lit. ü§ôüèº

5 Pointers

1st: It was not easy to walk at the ice with the ice skate. Kudos to those who are trying really hard to practice dancing with it, you guys are awesome.
I best suggest to rent a polar bear for a firt timer. It really helps.

2nd: I forgot to bring a jacket with me it was so cold inside the rink. So, I recommend don't forget to bring one jacket with you guys.

3rd: For you to enjoy the moment try to copy-cat the others. I swear, it can help you to move slowly but surely.

4th: Don't forget to record a video clip when you are a first timer. I bet you, it will makes your jaw and belly hurt due to laughing hard. Record every moment and have fun.

5th: Don't forget to take a photo and slay your ice skate. As if you've never been through many struggles strolling with it. ‚õ∏",5 stars,2020,megamall
"They have cut off even if you are paying for unlimited ice skating. On weekends, if you arrive at 1pm, there's tendency that your time in will be 3:15pm. If you have a 2-hr ticket (limited time), chances are, you'll be at 3:00 or 5:30 batch. With the long lines coming in, plus long lines in getting shoes, and wearing it, you will start to skate at around 3:30 or 3:45pm. They will ask you to leave the ice at 4:30 to resurface the rink and your time will end at 5:00 pm (so, that's basically 1 hour only, not 2hrs!). They will not let you come in anymore after they clean the rink. Lockers are for one time use (one open and one close), they will lock your locker and confiscate your things if you opened it for any reasons at all. If you rest and take off your ice skating shoes, they will confiscate the shoes (no shoes on the floor), and you need to fall in line again to get one (long lines during cleaning period). Very, very frustrating.",3 stars,2023,megamall
"Good place for those who know how to ice skate. Not so beginner friendly. Polar bears that serve as guides are not always available. You need to line up on the waiting list. It is more okay if you have your own shoes as your exact size may not be available on your schedule. Skating shoes are included in the price, but most of the shoes are old. Good to try, but I'm not thrilled to go back.",3 stars,2023,megamall

For she told a customer what would the customer do or ""Ano ang magagawa mo?""

"Overall, this ice rink is like an oasis in the desert in Manila. The ice skate shoe rentals are in disrepair which makes it very hard to find your balance on the ice if you are an advanced skater.

Coming in the early morning (10:00 AM) on Sundays is probably one of the best times to ice skate for beginners or people who want to work on technique. I avoid the peak times as it sometimes feels a little bit too crowded and renting perfectly-sized boots becomes tricky.,4 stars,2018,megamall

My daughter told me the skates are not as dull as at the MOA ice rink. Also, you can choose between figure skates and hockey skates at no extra charge.
While the MOA rink has for hockey players, the Megamall rink has more figure skaters. Overall it‚Äôs a good experience for the kids. If you need to ice time while I the Philippines, this rink is the better of the two we‚Äôve been to.",5 stars,2019,megamall

"Best to bring your own skates.
The entrance fee gets you a pair of garbage skates. Their rentals are all cheap, shameful pairs of dung.",2 stars,2024,megamall
"nice,,,",5 stars,2023,megamall
"Finally! 1st time trying ice skating and super FUN! I think you can pay less if you buy online, but we did the research too late. Either way, we had a great time and we were so tired that we didn't finish the 2 hours ü•≤ we rented the teddy bear for ‚Ç±125/hour, would definitely try again next time ü•∞",5 stars,2024,megamall
"First time ice skating and I experienced super fun. They have padisco lights and for newbies you can rent a polar bear. The guides are also super helpful because they will teach you how not to fall, but along the way you'll also learn something so for sure the 2nd time I go I'm not stuck on one side anymore.",5 stars,2023,megamall
"I went at 6 o'clock on a Saturday and couldn't get in because I didn't have enough shoes.
I went at 6pm on Sunday and was told to go in at 7:30.
There is a 2-hour pass and a day pass, and 2 hours is enough to ride.
If you get a 2-hour pass, you'll have to wait if you don't go on time, so it's better to go on time.
Times and fees are attached with photos.

Temperature - It was short-sleeved shorts and it wasn't cold at all. I was almost sweating. There doesn't seem to be a need to bring thick clothes.

Shoes - There were no sizes 10 and 11, so I wore size 12. There is a size measuring machine so you don't have to find out in advance. And if you go at 5 or 7 o'clock, your shoes may be dirty and wet because other people wore them at the previous time.

Lockers - I ordered a 2-hour pass for two people, and lockers were automatically included in the receipt. 50 pesos is automatically added.
First, I had to put my shoes and bag in, but it was full after I put in one backpack. I went into the skating rink with my bag and got kicked out. You cannot carry bags inside. If you have a lot of luggage, buy more lockers.

Polar Bear - Hold and ride is a tool for beginners. It's 100 pesos per hour, but no one cares about the time. And because there are not enough numbers, if you rent it late, you have to wait with a waiting number.
They are also made so that you can sit on Polar Bear's lap, and although they are all different sizes, they are the same price. I rented a small one and couldn't even sit on it, so I ended up replacing it later. They say I can't exchange it with other people, but I still don't understand.

People - Most people are not good at riding. And there are about 10 to 20% of people who are very good at riding, and they seem to be aspiring athletes or practicing professionals. The receptionists were not friendly.",3 stars,2023,megamall
"There are sizes 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13, but no 10? Didn't even say there was no stock before I paid the P450. The skates are still smelly + The ice was not properly cleaned before our batch",1 star,2024,megamall
"Provided shoes 3 sizes larger, can't provide refunds despite not preparing for a regular volume of people, broken at one end, and the music speaker is broken; Just go to MOA",1 star,2024,megamall
"I never expected to be able to go skating‚õ∏Ô∏è in ManilaüòÆ

It's 450p and the shoes are also cheap.
Locker fee is 50p, unlimited times a day‚òùÔ∏èüòâ
You are free to come and go.
Short sleeves and jeans are OK.
I think it is better for children to wear gloves.

You can almost have fun skiing just like in Japan ‚òùÔ∏è",5 stars,2019,megamall
"price is cheap
With a 2-hour pass, you have to go at a set time, which is a hassle, and it's very crowded to get in.
The link is also narrower than MOA",3 stars,2023,megamall
The ice skating boots hurt the feet even with socks on.. anyway we had fun.,4 stars,2023,megamall
"It's fun exp but I can't enjoy skating much because I don't know how. The given shaking skate is already wet, but you can request another dry one. It might be 500Php now but there is often a discount online at MetroDeal.",5 stars,2023,megamall
"It's nice, you can also just watch it",5 stars,2023,megamall

"It's a fun experience!
If your planning to go, just a heads up, register and secure your slot first early so that you'll have your slot. The activity is every two hours. Make sure to bring  a jacket, and don't use shorts if your a newbie. It's normal to fall but don't worry it doesn't hurt much. Just enjoy the 2 hours I guarantee that it's worth it.",5 stars,2024,moa
"If you go there, bring your own skates. They have skates there aswell but many of those are not in good condition which makes it very hard to skate with them.
But i liked that they have step by step signs which help you to orientate where to go first (paying) and what the following steps (shoes, icebears, entry,etc.) are.",2 stars,2024,moa
"Nice this is price
2 hours 350
Bear 125
Locker 50
Companion watcher 100",5 stars,2024,moa
"Ambience: the place is festive and properly lit. We went in as part of the first batch of the 2 hour pass, so the rink is not crowded. There are several skaters who i think are pros that are practicing around, some are ice skating students and most people are like us, just casual skaters. üòä Be sure to bring socks for hygiene reasons. They have lockers for rent, so one can secure their belongings.

Staff and service: we are satisfied with all those encounters we had with their staff. From the ticket buying, to the guard at the entrance, ice skates keeper and locker custodian.

Please be aware that their operating time is different with mall hours and the 2 hour pass starts at 11:15 am and cut-off at 6:30pm during weekend. Different schedule for weekdays. See the photo i attached with this review for the price and schedule.

Parking: it is located inside MOA, parking is available all around the mall.",4 stars,2023,moa
"It was my first time to do ice skating. It was easy to balance because I've roller skated before, I just had to get used to the slippery ice. We booked a time slot from 10am-12nn, and it wasn't busy, so I could skate without any worries bumping other people. Overall, it was a great and enjoyable experience.",4 stars,2023,moa
"Sm Skating offers a thrilling experience for skating enthusiasts. The smooth and well-maintained surfaces provide an ideal environment for both beginners and experienced skaters. Whether you're honing your skills or just enjoying a leisurely skate, Sm Skating provides a fun and welcoming atmosphere for all.

Downside: Skate shoes smell bad seems like it's not well maintained üòî",5 stars,2024,moa
We've enjoy it a lot even though we're struggling. Hahahha,5 stars,2024,moa
"First time trying to ice skate, ‚õ∏Ô∏è really enjoyed the experience. We got our tix at metro deal for 270 php and that is already good for 2 hours. We also paid for a locker for 50php and polar bear for 100php for an hour. Just a downside I think is that they only have a one time access for the lockers but overall it was a very fun experience especially if you were with your friends and loved ones.",4 stars,2023,moa
"Been here multiple times. It's really fun being here. It's better if you will try the unlimited pass para di kayo mabitin for less than Php. 500.
Bring your own socks or you can just buy sa store at the side. It's not really cold when you're inside na kaya it's okay not to wear jacket but it's up to you of course.",5 stars,2023,moa
"It is good to have fun, dates and exercise here... Don't go if you will be the only one, you maybe bored to death.

"We love Ice skating! It's just that, it is more expensive now that before pandemic, yet it's okay. üòä No Walk ins, you must schedule or book your session. ‚Ä¶",5 stars,2023,moa
"The kids really enjoyed ice skating and had so much fun!

To give a little bit of review though, maybe because it recently opened, I mean it was closed because of pandemic, so people are flocking and eager to ice skate that caused long lines at the counter. We queued for 30 minutes at around 1PM, the afternoon pass already sold out and what was available is only the 5:15PM 2-hour skate.

Despite being crowded it was still a fun, accident free afternoon.

Btw, you can bring food inside. The only snack you can buy from is Potato Corner fries which took 40 mins to be served. If you have a companion they can buy from outside restaurants.",4 stars,2022,moa
"Rude, impatient, inhospitable staff. Went there during opening hours on a weekday, yet overall service and experience was horrible. Skates given are also too worn out.

I also found fresh gum inside the skates after asking for a resize, which does not make sense considering the rink just opened (please check on the employee that gives out the skates -- they also gave out faulty skates)

Whole experience was unbearable!",1 star,2023,moa
Typical ice skating rink. Crowded as to be expected of a rink located in a large shopping mall. They charged me the price of a movie ticket just to go in and watch my 7yo daughter skate. I hate these kind of captive pricing schemes. Should be against the law. I'm trying to keep my 7yo daughter safe. It's not like I'm trying to watch Connor McDavid practice.,3 stars,2023,moa
"The mall of asia ice skating rink is quite spacious. Even though there are alot of people, it is still not too crowded because they do crowd control. You can book a slot every 2 hours or get a ticket for unlimited time the whole day or half day.

They also have a locker which you can pay for a fee. The biggest downside is the smelly helmet and smelly skates. Definitely feels unsanitized and unclean. They should really do something on the cleanliness of the rental items.",3 stars,2023,moa
"For beginners best day to come here every weekdays not weekends. Mostly weekends crowded na!

The sad part here is those practicing figure skating
Some occupy entire space
That might cause complications if you're beginner or just wanna try new.

Hockey game here is ok
Just don't forget to bring jackets if can't withstand coldness.

Enjoy!",3 stars,2019,moa
"Very good experience especially if you're the type to try new things.

It's better to come early as 1 fee (450php) is good for a wholeday access. Plus, the ice rink is smoother since there's not yet many who've used it.
If you have things, you can opt to rent a locker for a day's use -costs 50php.",4 stars,2019,moa
"Rental skates smelled like death. Bring your own if you have them, otherwise bring lots of soap or alcohol to wash your feet after. Nasty",1 star,2024,moa
"SM Skating Rink certainly earns a well-deserved 5 out of 5 stars in my recent experience. The skating rink's commitment to providing a fun and enjoyable experience, along with its well-maintained facilities, make it a standout destination for skating enthusiasts and beginners alike.

The skating rink's spacious layout, smooth ice surface, and modern amenities create an ideal environment for skating. Whether you're a seasoned skater or trying it for the first time, the rink provides a comfortable space to glide and enjoy the ice.

The range of skating sessions, from public sessions to lessons, caters to different skill levels and preferences. The availability of skate rentals and safety precautions ensure that everyone can enjoy the experience.

The skating rink's location within the expansive mall complex adds to its convenience and accessibility. The friendly and attentive staff members contribute to a positive and enjoyable visit.

In summary, SM Skating Rink is a must-visit destination for those seeking a fun and memorable skating experience. With its well-maintained facilities, variety of skating options, and commitment to customer satisfaction, it earns a full five stars as a top-notch skating venue.",5 stars,2023,moa
Best for Kids and kids at heart not only this season but all year round,5 stars,2023,moa
I enjoyed my 1st time experience in ice skating here. I just hope they change the caps/helmet because some of it are stinky.,4 stars,2023,moa
"It's fun to be here. Plus you get to watch some talented people performing such wonderful ice skating dances there (though they're not performers there, only civilian people too who just wanted to play too)",5 stars,2023,moa
"An employee at the return and claim counter was very rude. He was talking about the lady who exchanged the size of her skates as soon as she left the counter, he said that she was not listening and hard-headed because he already told her about how to pick the size of skates while making faces, while I was standing in front of him, exchanging mine because the first ones felt uncomfortable.

The skates that they replaced were very old and smelly. The pads were broken and the laces were not matching, the experience was unenjoyable and painful. We left after 30 mins because the skates sucked. What a waste of time and money.",1 star,2023,moa
Expensive. If you will avail locker your going to pay 100 pesos. They still use the old skating shoes yet they also have new one. Color white. Their time is advance than our watch 10mins. Which is annoying.,3 stars,2018,moa
Took my family ice skating here. The facility looked nice but the rental skates were not sharpened and had no edges. My sons and I play hockey and we‚Äôre hoping to practice some edge work during open skate and we‚Äôre unable to get any meaningful ice time. If you regularly skate bring your own skates.,2 stars,2023,moa
"Full-sized rink with a manageable volume of people for one to speed up. Not many of the visitors are stable on the skates so you need to keep an eye out.

400 PHP for a single adult, or 600 for two. Add another 50 PHP for a locker to stow away your belongings whilst on the ice. You're allowed to determine your shoe size before borrowing a pair of skates through a set of foot castings.

The above prices are only for figure skates, which have those horrible spikes at the front. Not until we were inside did we found out that the hockey skates were an additional 400 PHP per head.",3 stars,2019,moa
"The place and ambience is soooooo cool and great for bonding with friends, family and the like",5 stars,2024,moa
"This was my second time ice skating and I've been to Megamall's previously. I was under the impression that the shoes/skates were changed to new ones but I guess not. I also thought that MOA has their rink outside the mall with a different building, but it was on the main building (I guess) and the space for skating was quite okay. During our visit, a lot of people were there, so there's a 'traffic jam' on the locker area as well as the space outside the rink. It was too small for a lot of people (especially during the times were in the time slots/break thingies occur). Staffs were accommodating and were approachable. Overall, pretty good experience!",4 stars,2022,moa
"The whole experience was great, the place and the process before you enter the ice field/arena was goods.",5 stars,2023,moa
"Ice skating rink is super unsafe. Staff ignores you when you ask for help and do not even bother to look at you when talking. The skates were broken and the shoelaces were falling apart. Furthermore, the ice skating rink was full too capacity and yet the staff kept letting people enter. The worst, however, would be the staff; their rudeness and ignorance ruins your day.",1 star,2023,moa
We enjoyed our time and having free lockers were very convenient. There's also a place where you can measure your foot size for the skates.,5 stars,2022,moa
Awesome üòé and fun for all ages ‚Ä¶,5 stars,2023,moa
Great experience. Make sure to rent the polar bear. üòÅ ‚Ä¶,5 stars,2023,moa
"The ticket price is worth the price. They have a locker wherein you can keep your things as you skate. Since there is only one entrance to the rink, you‚Äôll have to wait for those who are ahead of you to go inside before you can go in (if you can‚Äôt skate, because you‚Äôll be needing a support, but if you can skate on your own, you can immediately go inside the rink and enjoy skating). My friend took a lot of time before she was able to get in since she doesn‚Äôt know how to skate.

For those who doesn‚Äôt know how to skate, get a polar bear üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è So you can enjoy more!",5 stars,2023,moa
memorable experience!,5 stars,2023,moa
I was very impressed with the rink. It is quite a large rink and the ice is very smooth. Unlimited entry pass is priced at PHP390 and companion pass at PHP100. The rink was rather empty when we were there as it was 11am on a weekday. The rink is in a huge mall with many restaurants and departmental stores.,4 stars,2019,moa
"My fianc√© and I had a great time on the ice, but if there is one bad experience I had it would be the 'meh' attitude from the ice skate staff, I specifically asked for hockey type skates and the staff was adamant they didn't have anything like that. So, fine I put on the male figure ice skates which were absolutely uncomfortable. Since I already paid the entrance fee, why not right?

An hour later when I returned these I saw others with hockey skates and I asked the staff about them, the guy simply walked away! The heck kind of service is this?",3 stars,2019,moa
"It was fun experience but the service and the rental shoes sucks, I chose size 8 that fits my feet and they gave me a shoe, yet when I wanted to replace it since the lace is severely damaged I asked for a size 7, yet they told me ""its a size 7"" when I originally said I wanted an 8, so instead I told them ""okay, just give me another pair THAT IS NOT DAMAGED"" then they gave me a not that good but bearable. it was my first time. and not planning going back",2 stars,2023,moa
"Wasting time to go there but they don't have enough shoes.
And the worst part is, they don't feel sorry at all. Service sucks. Hopefully meron 0 star or munus on Google",1 star,2023,moa
It‚Äôs great fun for children and adventurous adults . Follow the procedure to sign up specify what extras you want . Having visited many times you need to be aware that the provided boots are now getting worn considerably and this time an open safety pin was found in one of them giving a slight injury . It‚Äôs time they considered a new boot purchase and would it harm staff to check out the boots and other equipment?,3 stars,2023,moa

The skating rink was one of the best ones here in the Philippines.

My daughter enjoyed it. Price is worhy for the 2 hour session. There us an option to get a coach. Buy if you are friendly enough  you can find someone that is willing to give you tops. Must be reserved for earlier sessions because in the afternoon the line is too long.,5 stars,2023,moa
"Poor, I‚Äôm not even sure where to begin. Crowded. VERY crowded. Avoid going any weekend. I‚Äôm pretty sure this place is a safety hazard. Broken skates, crowded rink, not friendly for beginners or for experienced skaters (since it‚Äôs so crowded). No organization. They allow more people in than they have amenities. Limited lockers, seats, skates, yet they allow 3-4 times their own capacity. They have an eating area but 0 spaces to eat properly.",1 star,2023,moa

Its not cold inside

GOOD SOCKS!!!!

I think SM is now being practical in allocating spaces for such activities as there are now alot to choose from.

"Now that the pandemic is getting back to normal life the malls and restaurants are opening. This goes double for the mall of Asia. I am pretty good with knowing how the mall is layed out, but now that the pandemic is sort of. Lifeting they are completely redoing the mall. It was a completely different place. I had a hard time.

"The staff in the claim and return of ice skating shoes was impolite and rude. I came back and nicely asked for exchange because the lace of shoes he gave me was broken. He did exchange but he almost threw it to me and my hand was hit by the blade. What if he does it to children?

*He was rude even the first time we claim our shoes.

"I did not enjoy the ice skating here in SM MOA to say the least.  The ice skates are so dull and old that you can just barely move.  The skating rink is unsafe since there‚Äôs no flow for the skaters to follow unlike other skating rinks.  With everyone moving in any direction, surface of the ice has so many criss crossing scratches which don‚Äôt get fixed even after resurfacing.  This makes it more difficult to skate.",1 star,2023,moa

"Great value. It is better to go earlier in the day to get the most from the daily pass.  You will avoid the crowds and since the ice is not regularly Zambonied, it is also in best condition early.",4 stars,2020,moa
Rink is nice and as expected. The employees aren't too attentive though. Employee at the front desk was busy having a conversation with a co-worker and had her back turned when we arrived. You think they'd stop to take our money but kept conversating until I verbally interrupted them. The employee working the skate pick up area seemed to only communicate through pointing and nodding. I asked him a question and he pointed without even looking up from his phone.,3 stars,2019,moa
"The ice is not bad.  However, each person has only a Limited amount of time to skate (I think an hour) compared to the MEGAMALL rink.

"Pros:
You get to ice skate in the tropics.
Decent size ice rink.

Cons:
You pay just to go inside the seating area in addition to the skates rental.
Ice rink possibly gets resurfaced only once a day?
Skate blades are so dull and poorly maintained that the first skates were badly bent yet it's still being rented out.

You'd be better off bringing your own skates if you have one. But then there's that beat up ice surface you'll have to deal with.",2 stars,2020,moa
"Olympic size skating rink,my only worries is nobody's watching for beginners,many minor accident happen ,i hope they also change the skating shoes to a better oneüëçüèªüòäü•∞ ‚Ä¶",4 stars,2023,moa
"We came here(MOA) to try out ice skating in the Philippines. According to my daughter, the rental skates are big and heavy and the blades are dull. The alternative is to rent hockey skates for an hour at over 400 pesos. My son said the blades on the hockey skates, an old pair of Bauer Vapors, are also dull.  Admission is about 500 pesos for a full day. That means you can skate for a while, then take off and come back later to skate. The rink closes when the mall closes.
We did not see any facility for sharpening skates.
There was a hockey practice at 8:30pm but weren‚Äôt allowed to watch it.
We asked if there‚Äôs a Zamboni and were told that there is one. We never saw it though. The ice rink is currently located on the third floor of MOA. I think it was originally on the ground floor. So I doubt that the ice is resurfaced at all.

The kids had fun despite the condition of the equipment.

Five stars for a nice place to escape the heat and humidity.
Subtracted three stars (one per kid) for not allowing the kids to form a train. üòù",2 stars,2019,moa

Completely unreasoned entrance to the court and there is a constant hustle. Rental skates are all old and blunt. Preparation of ice and filling it happens irregularly and therefore the quality of the ice rink is poor.

Above all, this coolness has become a place of relaxation in the Philippines, and considering that it has even led to the birth of Olympic athletes, I think it is a great achievement.
